# TheCounter
Second Exam Project of the Start2Impact Academy - A Simple Counter

---------------------------
The project:
---------------------------

Let's make a simple application that functions as a counter.

Develop a JavaScript application that allows the user to increment and decrement the counter value.

The user, upon entering the page, will display 0 as the counter value and will have two +/- buttons to change the counter value.

The application must be developed with JavaScript. The use of Jquery is not allowed, no frameworks (React, Angular, Vue...) are allowed.

The use of external JavaScript libraries is allowed if necessary.

The +/- buttons, and also the counter value display must be implemented with JavaScript.

Any additional functionality that is deemed necessary is allowed.
