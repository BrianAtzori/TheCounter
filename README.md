   Second Exam Project of the Start2Impact Academy - A Simple Counter
    
  The project:
  Let's make a simple application that functions as a counter.

  Develop a JavaScript application that allows the user to increment and decrement the counter value.

  The user, upon entering the page, will display 0 as the counter value and will have two +/- buttons to change the counter value.

  The application must be developed with JavaScript. The use of Jquery is not allowed, no frameworks (React, Angular, Vue...) are allowed.

  The use of external JavaScript libraries is allowed if necessary.

  The +/- buttons, and also the counter value display must be implemented with JavaScript.

  Any additional functionality that is deemed necessary is allowed.

I worked on The Counter following the rules of the project but adding some style to the application, associating it with a "cold" and "mathematical" style. 

The user has a simple application that allows him to increase or decrease a value, and as additional functionality I set up 3 modules:

- Saving a value, for example can be useful if you are keeping points from a game, up to a maximum of 3 values.

- The ability to set an initial value, so that first of all you can start over if necessary but also if you need to start from a specific number. 

- The multiplier function, so you can count by adding a ten, a hundred or a thousand as you choose.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1) If needed you can set the starting value (Obvious Number Only) with the first input area
2) With the counter you can add 1 to the displayed value or you can decrease the value
3) If you need to save the value you can give it a label and press the button in the third input area. The value will be displayed in the dedicated space with its label.
4) If you need to use the counter with bigger numbers, you can use the multipliers.
